            <h3>What is Dungeons and Dragons?</h3>
            <p>Dungeons & Dragons (D&D) is a tabletop role-playing game where players create characters and embark on adventures in a 
                fantasy world. A Dungeon Master (DM) guides the story, describes settings, and controls non-player characters, 
                while players make decisions for their characters and interact with the environment. The game involves rolling dice 
                to determine outcomes of actions, fostering creativity, teamwork, and storytelling. 
                It's all about having fun and exploring imaginative scenarios together!</p>
